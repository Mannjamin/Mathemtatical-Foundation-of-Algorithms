## Variables:
A variable is a symbol used to represent a mathematical construct
> Numbers, sets, lists , vectors, matrices, …

Often lower case letters or Greek letters are used
> *x, y, z,* Ω, *α*, β, …

Variables in Mathematics are treated the same as variables within a programming language. They can be thought of as a box containing a value that can be read from or written to.

## Sets:

 - A set is a finite or infinite collection of items.
 - A set has no order.
 - You cannot index a set… 
 - A set only contains one copy of an item.

Symbols | Meaning

a ∈ A | Item is a member of set A.
a ∉ A | Item is not a member of set A.
Ø | Empty Set.
