## Variables:
A variable is a symbol used to represent a mathematical construct
> Numbers, sets, lists , vectors, matrices, …

Often lower case letters or Greek letters are used
> *x, y, z,* Ω, *α*, β, …

Variables in Mathematics are treated the same as variables within a programming language. They can be thought of as a box containing a value that can be read from or written to.

## Sets:

 - A set is a finite or infinite collection of items.
 - A set has no order.
 - You cannot index a set… 
 - A set only contains one copy of an item.

Symbol | Name | Meaning / Definition
:--------: | :-----: |:--------:
a ∈ A | Element of |Item is a member of set A.
a ∉ A | Not Element of |Item is not a member of set A.
Ø | Empty Set |Represents an Empty Set.
*/A/*|Cardinality|The number of elements of set A.
***R***|Real Numbers|A set of Real Numbers.
***Z***|Integers| A set of Integers.
***N***|Natural Numbers| A set of Natural Numbers.

> The entire alphabet can be used to define a set.

### Set Operators:

#### Creating A Set:

The process of defining a set:
 1. A = {variable : inclusion criteria}.
 2. A = {n^2^ : n is an integer and 0 ≤ n ≤ 5}.
 3. A = {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25}.

#### Unifying a set:

The process of unifying a set:
 1. A = B ∪ C.
 2. A = *{a : a ∪ B **OR** a ∈ C}*.
 3. A contains all of B and C.

 #### Intersection of a set:
 
 The process of Intersection:
 1. A = B  ∩  C
 2. A = *{a : a ∈ B **AND** a ∈ C}*
 3. A contains only what B and C have in common

#### Subsets and Superset:
##### If A is a Set:
Symbol | Name | Meaning / Definition
:--------: | :-----: |:--------:
B ⊆ A | Subset |B ⊆ A means B is a Subset of A **AND** Set B is included in Set A.
B ⊂ A|Proper/Strict Subset|B is a subset of A, but B is not equal to A.
B ⊇ A|Superset|B is a Superset of A. Set-B includes Set-A.
A ⊅ B|Not a Superset|Set-B is not a superset of Set-A

#### Subtraction:

The process of Subtraction:
 1. A = C\B.
 2. A = *{a : a ∈ C **AND** a ∉ B}.*
 3. A is B with all the elements of C removed
